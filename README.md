# Checklist
Checklist Application Written In Ruby with Ruby on Rails Framework

Description:
Product allows for sign up, sign in, log out with user interaction. Once signed in a user can create tasks and once there is a minimum of one existant can be edited, viewed or deleted.

Planned features:
While product is in a working state, the email used by a client is never checked therefore cannot be verified. Secondly while bootstrap was used as a gem, it did not work for unknown reasons. Improving the style of the web app would be very useful. Tasks are not checked off when completed, istead if a client wishes to remove them, they must be deleted. In future a detailed list of all completed tasks would be implemented.
